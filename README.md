# Plant-Watering
This is a website created using React.js which has not been deployed.

# HOW TO USE/OPEN 
1) To use this website and see its displays you will have to download node.js on you computer
2) After node.js has been install go on cmd and write: npm create-react-app my-app
3) Use console to: cd my-app 
4) Use console to: npm install react-redux 
5) Use console to: npm install redux
6) Use console to: npm install redux-thunks
7) After all the needed packages have been installed please copy the files from this zip onto the folder and open with you IDE. (I like VSCODE).
8) Can open in vscode by being in the folder directiory of the project on your cmd and type: .code
9) That should create a new project in that directory on your VS Code. I believe. 
10) Once in console to run said app just type npm.start while being in the folders directory on the console

# WHEN RUNNING MY CODE
PLease make sure to look at the console by pressing f12 and inspecting element. It will show you states being changed and in theory watering my the plants based on id. 
Thanks.
